        referred to as "Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please refrain from using the bot.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
      <p>
        Sasquatch Bot collects and stores the following data for the purpose of statistical analysis, message moderation, 
        and server management:

      <h2>3. Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>
        All collected data is securely stored using Google Firestore, a cloud-based database solution. The bot uses 
        an API to transmit data from the database to the website for statistical analysis. We implement security 
        measures to protect your data from unauthorized access or disclosure, but we cannot guarantee absolute 
        security due to the nature of online services.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Moderation Features</h2>
      <p>
        Sasquatch Bot includes the ability to mute, kick, ban, filter, and delete messages that contain profanity or

        Sasquatch Bot does not assume responsibility for any misuse of these features.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mute</strong>: Temporarily prevents a user from participating in voice or text channels.</li>
        <li><strong>Kick</strong>: Removes a user from the server.</li>
        <li><strong>Ban</strong>: Permanently removes a user and prevents them from rejoining the server.</li>
        <li><strong>Message Filtering</strong>: The bot can automatically detect and delete messages containing 
        profanity or other undesirable content based on server-defined rules.</li>
